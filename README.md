## Description

This module installs, configures and schedules the ISPProtect php malware scanner
on a node.

The module downloads the package from ispprotect.com or a custom URL. After that,
it unpacks and configures the package. Lastly the module schedules auto updates
for the scanner and actual scanning of a directory tree.

## Setup

### What ispprotect affects

This module installs the clamav package by default, you can prevent this by
setting the manage_clamav parameter to false.


### Beginning with ispprotect

Apart from the mail_recipient parameter, it should be usable using the defaults.
For real work you will need a license key, the trail expires after just a number
of tries.

## Usage

```
class { 'ispprotect':
  mail_recipient => 'you@example.com',
  scan_target => '/var/www/mywebsite',
}
```
